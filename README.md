# Incremental-Backups
Incremental File-Based Backup Script

This script performs incremental file-based backups by comparing the modification time of files with the last backup time. It creates backups only for files that have been modified since the last backup.

Configuration:
The script uses a configuration file (backup.conf) to specify the source path, backup path, and various time frames.

Backup Process:
1. The script reads the configuration file and retrieves the necessary settings.
2. It checks if the backup path exists and creates it if necessary.
3. The last backup time is obtained from the configuration file. If not specified, the default value is the earliest possible time.
4. The script walks through the source path and checks each file's modification time.
5. If a file has been modified since the last backup or it is the first backup run, a backup of the file is created.
   - The backup file name includes the current date and time to avoid naming conflicts.
6. After all eligible files are backed up, the last backup time is updated in the configuration file.
7. The script completes the backup process.

Logging:
The script logs its activities using the logging library. It provides information about the backup process, including the files being backed up and any changes detected.

Usage:
To use the script:
1. Set up a configuration file (backup.conf) with the required settings.
2. Run the script periodically, such as from cron or systemd, to perform automatic backups.
3. The script will compare file modification times with the last backup time and create backups for modified files.

Note:
- The script assumes that the source path and backup path are valid and accessible directories.
- It is recommended to review the log file (backup.log) for information and potential issues during the backup process.
